# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

I am a systems engineering student from MedellÃ­n, Colombia. I work at the **Integrated Systems Laboratory (LIS)** on University of Antioquia as Technical manager and leader of the team of programming assistants.

I enjoy everything related to technology, systems and programming, and also sharing these topics with others by teaching; By the way I would like to work not only as engineer and software developer but also as teacher because of I believe that the most you explain, the most you learn.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning _ANSIBLE_ to automate processes in the LIS

### Interested in
- Cibersecurity
- Software development
- Operating systems and Linux
